                    We're reframing blood donation as an integral part of a proactive and healthy lifestyle. 
                    Rakta empowers athletes and health-conscious individuals to treat donation as a measurable 
                    aspect of their fitness journey. Through data-driven insights into physiological recovery, 
                    eligibility tracking, and wellness metrics, we're building a community that celebrates the 
                    positive impact of strategic blood donation.
